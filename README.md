#### RB120 (Object Oriented Programming)

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) represents a major departure from procedural programming, and requires not only an entire new way of thinking, but also requires learning a whole new set of vocabulary and concepts. If this is your first time delving into Object Oriented Programming, this is going to be a difficult course for you. The concepts themselves will be easy to pick up, but putting it together will be quite difficult.

As you move forward in your programming journey, the vast majority of code you'll come across is likely written in OO style. Procedural style is usually only used when writing smaller scripts. All your favorite libraries and frameworks are written in OO style. Building an OO program from scratch will force that knowledge upon you. You won't be an expert OO programmer after this course, but you'll have hands on experience with OOP and how to code OO programs in Ruby.

To start, this lesson will guide you through some basic OO concepts and vocabulary. You'll need this knowledge in order to build OO programs. Take your time here and work through the exercises.
